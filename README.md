🎤 EchoLearn

EchoLearn is a real-time AI speaking tutor that helps students learn by explaining concepts out loud instead of just rereading notes.

The app listens to student explanations, evaluates them in real time, and gives natural voice feedback to help guide learning.

🚀 Why EchoLearn?

Students are often told that the best way to understand something is to explain it. But in reality, most students either explain to friends at the same level or just talk to themselves — which means mistakes can go uncorrected.

At the same time, studying is becoming more passive with AI tools, where students read answers instead of working through concepts themselves.

EchoLearn was built to make studying more active, interactive, and closer to explaining material to a real tutor.
